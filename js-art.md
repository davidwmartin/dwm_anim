## Project Ideas
* connected-particles lightning storm
	- use particle-connections.js script, but instead of always present connections trigger them on a mouse click, or at random times and coordinates, and watch the connections spread out like a web of electricity. 
* photo work
	- manipulate shapes over image BG, style via css image filters, do trippy ish. 
		- tunnel.psd (caitlin's neighborhood) -- animate triangles, changing sizes
		- trees-have-eyes.psd (mesa peak) -- squares generating out in swarms like leaves
* abstract laser-soundwaves -- oscillate y value on amplitude of sound source or something, x by time
